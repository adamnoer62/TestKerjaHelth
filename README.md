## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Setup (Bun + Elysia)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd apps/backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `apps/backend` directory and add your database connection string.

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/database_name"
    ```

4.  **Generate Prisma Client:**

    ```bash
    bunx prisma generate
    ```

5.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    This will create the database schema based on your Prisma model.

    ```bash
    bunx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

6.  **Seed the Database (Optional):**
    If you have a seed script, run it to populate the database with initial data.

    ```bash
    npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
    ```

7.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    bun run index.ts
    ```

    The backend server should now be running.

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Setup (Vue 3 + Vite)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd apps/frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be accessible at the local address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
